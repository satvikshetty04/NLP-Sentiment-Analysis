- Using N-gram models, employed the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree that could detect the sentiment of a sentence
- Trained the decision tree using a unigram model and a trigram model separately and performed a comparison in terms of precision, recall, and F-score
- Data set used: UCI ML Repository - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences
